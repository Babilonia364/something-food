# Hello, i'm a readme

## Running this project

To run this project you need to have node installed.

Just clone this repo (Git Clone), and install all the dependencies (yarn install/npm install).
I've build this project with npm so npm will be preferable over yarn in this project.

After that, npm run dev or yarn dev to run locally and be amazed by this project (KAPPA).


# IMPORTANT

Only the happy path has been implemented. Only Matsuri Concept will be working and only Temaki Salm√£o will be avaliable to be tested.

The others restaurants and foods aren't implemented because i didn't finish the json in time.

If you have problem because Matsuri Concept is closed, just go to data/mocks/restaurants and change his opening time. Update the page and done.
