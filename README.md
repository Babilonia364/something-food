## Running this project

To run this project you need to have node installed.

Just clone this repo (Git Clone), and install all the dependencies (yarn install/npm install).
I've build this project with npm so npm will be preferable over yarn in this project.

After that, npm run dev or yarn dev to run locally and be amazed by this project (KAPPA).
